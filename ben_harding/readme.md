## SLOTHBEAR TCP SERVER

* This is a simple tcp server.  It opens a connection, writes the request to a unique file and sends a fin packet back.
* To run the server, do a ``` node server.js ```
* Go find your file!
* It is probably the least useful server in the world.
* Testing using chai-http!  I love it!
